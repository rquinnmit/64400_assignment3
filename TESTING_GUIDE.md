# Testing Guide - Assignment 3

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Compile the Project:
```bash
cd build
cmake --build .
```

### Run the Simulation:
```bash
# From project root
.\build\assignment3.exe r 0.005
```

---

## üß™ Test Scenarios

### Test 1: RK4 Integrator (Recommended)
```bash
.\build\assignment3.exe r 0.005
```
**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ All three simulations running smoothly
- ‚úÖ Red sphere: nearly perfect circle
- ‚úÖ Pendulum: stable swinging motion
- ‚úÖ Cloth: realistic draping, no explosions

---

### Test 2: Trapezoidal Integrator
```bash
.\build\assignment3.exe t 0.001
```
**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ Simulations run (may be slightly less stable than RK4)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Red sphere: slight outward drift
- ‚úÖ Pendulum: stable but requires smaller timestep
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cloth: may be unstable with larger timesteps

---

### Test 3: Forward Euler (Unstable)
```bash
.\build\assignment3.exe e 0.0001
```
**Expected:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Red sphere: visible outward spiral
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Pendulum: may require very small timesteps
- ‚ùå Cloth: will likely explode (expected behavior!)

---

### Test 4: Stability Comparison
```bash
# Large timestep - RK4 handles it well
.\build\assignment3.exe r 0.01

# Same timestep - Euler explodes
.\build\assignment3.exe e 0.01
```
**Purpose:** Demonstrates why RK4 is superior for stiff systems

---

### Test 5: Reset Functionality
1. Run any simulation
2. Wait for motion to develop
3. Press **'R'** key
4. Verify all systems reset to initial state

---

## üéØ What to Look For

### Scene Layout:
```
Left: Red sphere (circular motion)
Middle: Blue spheres (pendulum chain)
Right: Wireframe grid (cloth)
```

### Circular Motion (Left):
- [ ] Red sphere visible
- [ ] Moving in circular path
- [ ] Euler spirals outward
- [ ] RK4 maintains radius

### Pendulum (Middle):
- [ ] 4 blue spheres in chain
- [ ] White lines connecting them
- [ ] Top sphere stays fixed
- [ ] Natural swinging motion
- [ ] Eventually settles

### Cloth (Right):
- [ ] 8√ó8 grid of lines visible
- [ ] Hanging from two top corners
- [ ] Falls and drapes naturally
- [ ] No explosions (with RK4)
- [ ] Stable equilibrium shape

## üìä Performance Benchmarks

| Integrator | Timestep | FPS (approx) | Stability |
|------------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| RK4 | 0.005s | 60+ | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| RK4 | 0.01s | 60+ | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| Trapezoidal | 0.001s | 60+ | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| Trapezoidal | 0.005s | 60+ | ‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| Euler | 0.0001s | 60+ | ‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| Euler | 0.001s | 60+ | ‚ùå |

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem: Simulation explodes immediately
**Solution:** 
- Use RK4 integrator
- Reduce timestep
- Check that you're using `r 0.005` not `e 0.005`

### Problem: Cloth doesn't move
**Solution:**
- Check gravity is enabled
- Verify particles aren't all fixed
- Increase timestep to see motion faster

### Problem: Nothing appears on screen
**Solution:**
- Check camera distance (should be ~10 units back)
- Verify lighting is working
- Try zooming out with mouse scroll

### Problem: Cloth tears apart
**Solution:**
- This is expected with Euler!
- Use RK4 integrator
- Reduce spring stiffness
- Increase drag coefficient

## üéÆ Interactive Controls

| Key/Action | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| R | Reset all simulations |
| Left Mouse Drag | Rotate camera |
| Right Mouse Drag | Pan camera |
| Mouse Scroll | Zoom in/out |
| ESC | Exit application |

## üìà Physics Tuning

### To make cloth more stable:
```cpp
// In SimulationApp.cpp, cloth section:
system->SetDragCoefficient(3.0f);  // Increase from 2.0
```

### To make cloth stiffer:
```cpp
const float structural_stiffness = 120.0f;  // Increase from 80
```

### To make cloth more flexible:
```cpp
const float flex_stiffness = 20.0f;  // Decrease from 40
```

### To change grid resolution:
```cpp
const int grid_size = 10;  // Increase from 8 (10√ó10 grid)
// Warning: More particles = slower simulation!
```
